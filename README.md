## 🚀 Why We Chose the Nimbus Idea

In today’s fast-paced world, **time is one of the most valuable resources**. Phone-based payments have made transactions quicker and more convenient — but we believe it can be **even faster**.

That's why our team created **Nimbus** — a facial recognition-powered payment solution combined with **Ecomust systems** to **accelerate the checkout process** and help store owners **manage their business more efficiently**.  
By replacing card scans or phone taps with **biometric authentication**, Nimbus enables **ultra-fast, secure, and contactless payments**.
